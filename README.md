# mavenOS
Operating system for Maven Prime

18 September 2018

Mark and Maven is a hiring platform. It improves on the resume with a profile that's dynamic, verifiable, and contextual, better-representing and valuing the job candidate. MaM profiles help to solve the pervasive issues in diversity, gender imbalance, and talent underavailability by improving the accuracy at which all candidates are priced, especially under-valued ones.

0.4 Release Notes
Mark and Maven gained some meta-features this week. It has a Github repository and a brand new names for its profiles: Dossiers. This title is meant to replace / improve upon resumes. (The resume is dead, long live the dossier). It also has a "signposted" application process, available online at GetaDossier and an online repository for its product release notes at mavenHistory and its weekly updates at mavenMilestones. mavenOS also gained a new feature: Admin can now add multiple locations to a users' profile at once.
