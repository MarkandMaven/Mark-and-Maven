# mavenOS
Operating system for Maven

26 September 2018

Mark and Maven is a hiring platform that improves on the resume with a dynamic, contextual, verifiable profile called a Dossier. Dossiers' ambition is to more accurately price human talent in the talent market, solving pervasive issues in diversity, gender imbalance, and talent underavailability. 

As a product, Mark and Maven manifest as a network of bots, jobs, companies, and people (each of them “nodes”). Nodes have operating systems and "profiles." Profiles are sets of "attributes." Attributes are characteristics/traits (as-yet undefined), experiences (as-yet undefined), and relationships (as-yet undefined) to other nodes. 

mavenOS is the operating system for a bot in the network called Maven.

mavenOS v0.5 was uploaded into the repository for the first time, with a number of new functions: sourceNetwork, sourceAttributesLibrary, nodeCreate, etc. Running mavenOS will cause the program to export a documentation of all of the network nodes, jobs, and allowable attributes of that Maven's network. 

0.5 Features list
- A programme called Maven can maintain a "local network of nodes" for the purposes of managing a hiring process
- An admin can create new network nodes for maven
- Maven can export a list of the nodes in its network
- Maven can export a list of the attributes allowed in its nodes
- Maven can export a list of the jobs in its network

ROADMAP 

0.6 Planned Features
- A candidate can create a dossier from a (Databuyer-hosted) URL (ie "click here and follow the instructions"
- mavenOS can automagically determine (verifiably) which countries a candidate has been to and add it to their Dossier

Icebox:
- mavenOS has defined the Characteristics/Traits of a node
- mavenOS has defined the Experiences of a node
- mavenOS has defined the Relationships of a node
- An admin can create (make), destroy (kill), amend (fix), and append (update) a node
- Candidates are stored in a cloud-based systems with backup and automated comms? Like Mailchimp? Maybe?
- mavenOS can communicate with email addresses in the outside world
