Mark and Maven is a hiring platform that uses a dynamic, contextual, verifiable profile data resource called a Dossier instead of a Resume. Dossiers' can more accurately price human talent, helping with issues of diversity, gender imbalance, and talent underavailability. The platform operates as a graph, including bots, jobs, companies, and humans as nodes. Each node has an operating system and a profiles. Profiles are made up of attributes. Attributes are characteristics/traits (as-yet undefined), experiences (as-yet undefined), and relationships to other nodes (as-yet undefined). 

This programme, mavenOS, is the operating system for a bot in the network called Maven.

0.7 Release Notes
I tried to update and organise the codebase around the discovery of the geopy codebase - very useful geolocator library for python. I haven't cracked it yet, so the analyst programme is dead and doesn't function, but I'll get through it shortly. 

0.7 Features list
- Tried to add country identification into the analyst module, found some source code to help, analyst.py is a work in progress however
- Mavens can now be separated out by name; this iteration is being used by Maven Harerra

ROADMAP 

0.8 Planned Features
- A Maven Prime will keep all of the Maven's sorted and coordinated
- Each mavenOS instance will run a new version of mavenOS
- mavenOS will have a new programme "config" which sets up the root folder, and inaugural network node
- mavenOS can determine from a raw data file which countries a candidate has been to and add as such to their Dossier

Icebox:
- A candidate can create a dossier from a (Databuyer-hosted) URL (ie "click here and follow the instructions"
- mavenOS has defined the Characteristics/Traits of a node
- mavenOS has defined the Experiences of a node
- mavenOS has defined the Relationships of a node
- An admin can create (make), destroy (kill), amend (fix), and append (update) a node
- Candidates are stored in a cloud-based systems with backup and automated comms? Like Mailchimp? Maybe?
- mavenOS can communicate with email addresses in the outside world
